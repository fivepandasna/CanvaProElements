## This project is archived and likely won't be maintained again
This is effectively any other image downloader, but it works only on Canva. I know how this could be done 100x better, but I lack the coding skills to actually make it and use the best methods. If I ever learn how to properly code, this may be revived and made far better.

## What it does
Canva Pro Elements is a firefox extension that allows you to download pro elements on the design websie, [Canva](https://www.canva.com) for free

## Installation

## Project Goals
<details open>
  <summary>Project Goals</summary>
    
The current main goal of this project is to allow users to easily download and use canva pro elements for free and without loss

In the future, I hope for this extension to automatically add pro elements to projects with customizable colours when right clicked in a context menu
